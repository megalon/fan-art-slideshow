Simple slideshow webpage to display artwork with an artist credit.

Images are loaded from subdirectories within the directory `build/public/images/`.
The name of the artist that is displayed is taken from the name of the directory the artwork is stored in.

Example: `build/public/images/megalon/test.png` would load the image and display the artist name `megalon`.

To add more artists, simply create a new directory and drop their artwork in there.
